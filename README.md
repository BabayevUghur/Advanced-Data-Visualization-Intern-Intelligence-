Here's my project for "Task 5 - Advanced Data Visualization".
In this project I used a dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/data
Firstly, in "Python File" I imported "vgsales.csv" file, I cleaned data, created 2D,3D and heatmap using plotly.express and after that I saved it as a new xlsx file which is named "for PowerBI" to work on it on Power BI to make clearer visuals, after that I imported the "for Power BI.xlsx" file to Power BI and created visuals, then saved it as "Power BI document".
